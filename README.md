# Matrix Row Reducer: Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan Row Scaling

This is a lightweight Python project to perform **row reduction** on matrices using two popular methods:

- **Gaussian Row Scaling** (Gaussian Elimination)
- **Gauss-Jordan Row Scaling** (Gauss-Jordan Elimination)

The project aims to help users understand and apply these methods for solving linear systems of equations, finding the rank of a matrix, or obtaining its reduced row echelon form (RREF). No external libraries are required, making it simple and easy to run.

## Features

- Implements **Gaussian Row Scaling** to reduce a matrix to echelon form.
- Implements **Gauss-Jordan Row Scaling** to reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form (RREF).
- Provides clear step-by-step output for educational purposes.
- Supports matrices of any size.
